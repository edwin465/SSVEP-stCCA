# SSVEP-stCCA
High performance but long calibration time 
Calibration-based algorithm

The size of calibration data cannot be less than the number of stimuli

We propose a new CCA algorithm that utilizes the intra- and inter-subject knowledge 
The size of calibration data can be less than the number of stimuli




## What is subject transfer CCA?  


### CCA intra-subject spatial filter  
Common spatial filter across different stimulus frequencies

### inter-subject SSVEP template  
Target subject's SSVEP template = weighted summation of source subjects' SSVEP templates  

Weight vector is shared across different stimulus frequencies  

## Two SSVEP datasets
Tsinghua benchmark dataset  
BETA dataset  

## Simulation study
